Something I found that needed improvement was the pacing in the game. Fighting took hours at a time to do and it was mostly due to the fact that there were SO MANY moves that you could use on your opponents. This avenue inspired me to make this application which just serves as a index of all the moves that have been published by this game.\r\n\r\n### Project structure\r\nIn order to make a proper GUI for java I wanted to make something that was made off of the Model, View, Controller infrastructure. The only reason why is because its easy to organize your programs if all of your functions are partitioned and organized; especially if your going to be doing this with a group. In particular I was assisted with publication by Brian Tate\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n Aaron Huerta (@aaronjh3), and Brian Tate\r\n\r\n### Other Projects\r\nCataclysm: Dark Days Ahead - Character Generator (http://aaronjh3.github.io/Cataclysm-Character-Generator/)",
